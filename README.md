The Kind of Trippy is the first proyect I made at [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp. After two weeks learning the fundamentals of front end, we had a monday to friday week to develop a game of our choice.

This project is built upon canvas and working with class the javascript. I also did the stage compositions with Photoshop

## Getting Started ‚å®Ô∏è

Use the arrows to move around the stage and collect the clues. If you press Space you will use your power, so that zombies do not attack you, but be careful the controls will be randomly reversed.
